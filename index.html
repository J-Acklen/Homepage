                Hi, I'm <strong>Joshua Acklen</strong>, a junior at the University of North Georgia pursuing a double major in <strong>Computer Science</strong> and <strong>Cybersecurity</strong>. I'm also working toward triple minors in Machine Learning, Application Development, and Advanced Computer Forensics—because why choose one specialty when you can master them all?

                As a certified <strong>Knack tutor</strong> with multiple 5-star reviews, I help fellow students navigate 1000-3000 level computer science courses. There's something incredibly rewarding about watching concepts click for someone who's been struggling with them.

                I'm an active member of UNG's ROTC program and serve as a Club Officer in the Cyber Unit, where I teach bash commands, cryptography fundamentals, and introductory cyber concepts. I've competed in numerous cybersecurity competitions including the National Cyber League (NCL), National Cyber Exercise (NCX), and NSA Codebreaker Challenges—constantly pushing myself to think like both an attacker and a defender.

                When I'm not in class or teaching, you'll find me deep in code, modding games, working on CNC and 3D printing projects, or jamming on my bass guitar. I believe the best learning happens when you're building something—whether that's a custom Arduino bot, a web application, or a perfectly tuned game mod.
